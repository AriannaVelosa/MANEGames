# MANEGames
This is a website that I made with my team on a final project for one of our classes. The languages used were HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The MERN stack was also utilized to make our website functional. Cookies as well as salting and hashing are also incorporated in this website.

We created a gaming website where you can create an account and play four different games: Blackjack, Boggle, Hangman, and Tic Tac Toe. You can friend people and see overall game statistics. For this game, I was in charge of creating the Hangman game as well as building the login and main html pages. 

To play, open the files on your computer. In the terminal, you will need to install mongoose, mongodb, nodejs, and express. My preferred method is to use npm to install. Once you have these installed, type "cd Main". Run the command "node mainServer.js" as this will start the game. Copy the link it will print out in the terminal into your preferred host such as Google or Safari. Then create your account and play!
